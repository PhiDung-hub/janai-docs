# Using Models
This guide provides comprehensive instructions on adding, customizing, and deleting models within the Jan platform. 

## Add Models

There are various ways to add models to Jan.

Currently, Jan natively supports the following model formats: 
- GGUF (through a llama.cpp engine)
- TensorRT (through a TRT-LLM engine)

### Download from Jan Hub

You can choose from a list of popular, recommended models directly from Jan app's Model Hub. 
These models are preconfigured with optimal runtime parameters. This is the easiest way to get started. 

1. Open the Jan app and navigate to the Hub.
2. Select models, clicking the `v` dropdown for more information. Models with the `Recommended` label will likely run faster on your computer.
3. After downloading a model, click **Use** to activate it. Ensure it's selected in the model dropdown for your thread.

### Add a Model Manually
You can also add a specific model that is not available within the **Hub** section by following the steps below:
1. Open the Jan app.
2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** on the bottom left of your screen.
3. Under the **Settings screen**, click **Advanced Settings**.
4. Open the Jan Data folder.
5. Head to the `~/jan/models/`.
6. Create a new model folder.
7. Create a `model.json` file inside the folder.
8. Insert the following `model.json` default code:
```json
{
  "id": "<unique_identifier_of_the_model>",
  "object": "<type_of_object, e.g., model, tool>",
  "name": "<name_of_the_model>",
  "version": "<version_number>",
  "description": "<brief_description_of_the_model>",
  "format": "<format_of_the_model_api_or_other>",
  "settings": "<additional_settings_as_needed>",
  "parameters": {
    "max_tokens": "<maximum_number_of_tokens_the_model_can_generate>",
    "temperature": "<temperature_setting_for_randomness_in_generation>"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "author": "<name_of_the_creator_or_organization>",
    "tags": ["<list_of_relevant_tags_describing_the_model>"]
  },
  "engine": "<engine_or_platform_the_model_runs_on>",
  "source": "<url_or_source_of_the_model_information>"
}
```
<Callout>
If you've set up your model's configuration in `nitro.json`, please note that `model.json` can **overwrite** the settings.
</Callout>
There are two important fields in `model.json` that you need to set:

#### Settings

This is the field where you can set your engine configurations. There are two important fields that you need to define for your local models:

| Term              | Description                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx_len`         | Defined based on the model's context size.                            |
| `prompt_template` | Defined based on the model's trained template (e.g., ChatML, Alpaca). |

To set up the `prompt_template` based on your model, follow the steps below: 
1. Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), an open-source machine-learning platform.
2. Find the current model that you're using (e.g., [Gemma 7b it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it)).
3. Review the text and identify the template.

#### Parameters

`parameters` are the adjustable settings that affect how your model operates or processes the data.
The fields in `parameters` are typically general and can be the same across models. An example is provided below:

<Callout type='info' emoji=''>
To see the complete list of a model's parameters, please see [below](/docs/models#model-parameters).
</Callout>

```json
"parameters":{
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "stream": true,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "presence_penalty": 0
}
```

### Import or Symlink Local Models

You can also point to existing model binary files on your local filesystem. 
This is the easiest and most space-efficient way if you have already used other local AI applications.

1. Navigate to the Hub.
2. Click on `Import Model` at the top.
3. Select the model or the folder containing multiple models.
4. Optionally, check the box to symlink the model files instead of copying them over the Jan Data Folder. This saves disk space.

<Callout type="warning">
Windows users should drag and drop the model file, as **Click to Upload** might not show the model files in Folder Preview.
</Callout>

## Model Parameters
A model has three main parameters to configure:
- Inference Parameters
- Model Parameters
- Engine Parameters

### Inference Parameters
Inference parameters are settings that control how an AI model generates outputs. These parameters include the following:
| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temperature**     | Influences the randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature leads to more random and diverse responses, while a lower temperature produces more predictable outputs. |
| **Top P** | Sets a probability threshold, allowing only the most likely tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold to be considered for generation. |
| **Stream**          | Enables real-time data processing, useful for applications needing immediate responses, like live interactions. It accelerates predictions by processing data as it becomes available. |
| **Max Tokens**      | Sets the upper limit on the number of tokens the model can generate in a single output.                                         |
| **Stop Sequences**  | Defines specific tokens or phrases that signal the model to stop producing further output. Useful for controlling output size and ending generation at logical points.        |
| **Frequency Penalty** | Modifies the likelihood of the model repeating the same words or phrases within a single output, reducing redundancy in the generated text.                                        |
| **Presence Penalty** | Encourages the generation of new and varied concepts by penalizing tokens that have already appeared, promoting diversity and novelty in the output.                           |

### Model Parameter
Model parameters are the settings that define and configure the model's behavior. These parameters include the following:
| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prompt Template**     | This predefined text or framework generates responses or predictions. It is a structured guide that the AI model fills in or expands upon during the generation process. For example, a prompt template might include placeholders or specific instructions that direct how the model should formulate its outputs. |

### Engine Parameters
Engine parameters are the settings that define how the model processes input data and generates output. These parameters include the following:
| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Context Length**     | This parameter determines the maximum input amount the model can generate responses. The maximum context length varies with the model used. This setting is crucial for the model’s ability to produce coherent and contextually appropriate outputs. |

<Callout type="info">
By default, Jan sets the **Context Length** to the maximum supported by your model, which may slow down response times. For lower-spec devices, reduce **Context Length** to **1024** or **2048**, depending on your device's specifications, to improve speed.
</Callout>

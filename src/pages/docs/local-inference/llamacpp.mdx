# llama.cpp

## Overview

Jan has a default [C++ inference server](https://github.com/janhq/nitro) built on top of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). This server provides an OpenAI-compatible API, queues, scaling, and additional features on top of the wide capabilities of llama.cpp.

## llama.cpp Extension

<Callout type='info'>
  Nitro is the default AI engine downloaded in Jan. No additional setup is needed.
</Callout>

This guide walks you through customizing your engine settings by configuring the `nitro.json` file.

### Prerequisites
<Tabs items={['Mac', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
    <Tabs.Tab >
      <Tabs items={['Mac Intel', 'Mac Silicon']}>
        <Tabs.Tab >
          Make sure you're using an Intel-based Mac. For a complete list of supported Intel CPUs, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro_(Intel-based)).
          
          <Callout type="info">
            This uses CPU by default, and no acceleration option is available. 
          </Callout>
          
          For Mac Intel, it is recommended to utilize smaller models. Expect the following outcomes:
           - High time to first token (ms) 
           - Low throughput (tokens/sec)
        </Tabs.Tab>

        <Tabs.Tab >
          Make sure you're using a Mac Silicon. For a complete list of supported Apple Silicon CPUs, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Silicon)
          
          <Callout type="info">
            This can use Apple GPU with Metal by default for acceleration. Apple ANE is not supported yet.
          </Callout>

          Using an adequate model size based on your hardware is recommended for Mac Silicon. Expect the following outcomes:
          - Low time to first token (ms)
          - High throughput (tokens/sec)
        </Tabs.Tab>
        
      </Tabs>
      ## Step-by-step Guide
      1. Navigate to the `App Settings` > `Advanced` > `Open App Directory` > `~/jan/engine` folder.
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab >
      Currently, only Windows with x86_64 architecture is supported by default. 
      
      <Callout type="info">
        It will use CPU by default if you do not have any GPU/ NPU.
      </Callout>
      
      Select a model size suited to your Windows hardware by looking for the `Recommended RAM` tag in the Hub. Expect the following outcomes:
        - High time to first token (ms) 
        - Low throughput (tokens/sec)

      ## Step-by-step Guide
      1. Navigate to the `App Settings` > `Advanced` > `Open App Directory` > `~/jan/engines` folder.
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Modify the `nitro.json` file based on your needs. The default settings are shown below.
<Callout type='info'>
  You can also edit the `model.json` file in the model folder, which overwrites the `nitro.json` settings.
</Callout>

```json title="~/jan/engines/nitro.json"
{
  "ctx_len": 2048,
  "ngl": 100,
  "cpu_threads": 1,
  "cont_batching": false,
  "embedding": false
}
```

The table below describes the parameters in the `nitro.json` file.

| Parameter       | Type        | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx_len`       | **Integer** | Typically set at `2048`, `ctx_len` provides ample context for model operations like `GPT-3.5`. (_Maximum_: `4096`, _Minimum_: `1`) |
| `ngl`           | **Integer** | Defaulted at `100`, `ngl` determines GPU layer usage.                                                                              |
| `cpu_threads`   | **Integer** | Determines CPU inference threads, limited by hardware and OS. (_Maximum_ determined by system)                                     |
| `cont_batching` | **Integer** | Controls continuous batching, enhancing throughput for LLM inference.                                                              |
| `embedding`     | **Integer** | Enables embedding utilization for tasks like document-enhanced chat in RAG-based applications.                                     |

<Callout emoji="">
  - By default, the value of `ngl` is set to 100, which indicates that it will offload all. If you wish to offload only 50% of the GPU, you can set `ngl` to 15 because most models on Mistral or llama.cpp are around ~ 30 layers.
  - To utilize the embedding feature, include the JSON parameter `"embedding": true`. It will enable Nitro to process inferences with embedding capabilities. Please refer to the [Embedding in the Nitro documentation](https://nitro.jan.ai/features/embed) for a more detailed explanation.
  - To utilize the continuous batching feature for boosting throughput and minimizing latency in large language model (LLM) inference, include `cont_batching: true`. For details, please refer to the [Continuous Batching in the Nitro documentation](https://nitro.jan.ai/features/cont-batch).

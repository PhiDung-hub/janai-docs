|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retrieval**         | Utilizes information from uploaded files, automatically retrieving content relevant to your queries for enhanced interaction.                                  |
| **Embedding Model**   | Converts text into numerical representations for machine understanding. Selection depends on your specific requirements and available resources.              |
| **Vector Database**   | Facilitates quick searches through stored numerical text representations to find relevant information efficiently.                                            |
| **Top K**             | Determines the number of top-ranked documents to retrieve, allowing control over search result relevance.                                                     |
| **Chunk Size**        | Sets the maximum number of tokens per data chunk, which is crucial for managing processing load and maintaining performance.                                           |
| **Chunk Overlap**     | Specifies the overlap in tokens between adjacent chunks to ensure continuous context in split text segments.                                                  |
| **Retrieval Template**| Defines the query structure using variables like `{CONTEXT}` and `{QUESTION}` to tailor searches to specific needs.                                                |

### OpenAI Models

You can also use specific OpenAI models you cannot find in the **Hub** section by customizing the `model.json` file, which you can see in the `~/jan/models/`. Follow the steps explained in the [Using Models](/docs/models) to add a model manually.

<Callout type='info'>
- You can find the list of available models in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list.
  - For example, if you want to use the [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo), you must set the `id` property to `gpt-4-1106-preview`.

- Double-check your API credentials to ensure they are correct.

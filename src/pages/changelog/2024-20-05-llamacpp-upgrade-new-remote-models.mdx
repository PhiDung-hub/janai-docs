<ChangelogHeader/>

With this release, we resolved an issue where Jan encountered errors running AI models locally due to a llama.cpp dependency. More GGUF models should work now! (We rebased to llamacpp b2865)

## New remote models: Anthropic & Cohere APIs

Jan now supports `Anthropic API` models `Command R` and `Command R+`, along with `Cohere`’s `Claude 3 Opus`, `Claude 3 Sonnet`, and `Claude 3 Haiku`.

## New integrations: Martian and OpenRouter

Jan supports `Martian`, a dynamic LLM router that routes between multiple models and allows users to reduce costs by 20% to 97%. Jan also supports `OpenRouter`, helping users select the best model for each query.

## GPT-4o Access

Users can now connect to OpenAI’s new model GPT-4o.

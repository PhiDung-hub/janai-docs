# Command Line Interface

Cortex ships with a Docker/Github inspired CLI for easy installation and usage.

## Check Installation

To check if Cortex CLI is installed correctly, run:

```
cortex -h
```

## Installation

- Quickstart [installation instructions](/cortex/quickstart)
- Device specific [installation instructions](/cortex/installation)

## Usage

For a full list of available CLI commands, [see here](/cortex/cli-overview).

```bash
Usage: cortex [options] [command]

# Output
Cortex CLI

Options:
  -h, --help       display help for command

Commands:
  models           Subcommands for managing models

  init|setup       Init settings and download Cortex's dependencies
                   Example: cortex init
                   
  serve [options]  Provide API endpoint for Cortex backend
                   Example: cortex serve

  chat [options]   Start a chat with a model
                   Example: cortex chat --model <model_id>

  run [options]    EXPERIMENTAL: Shortcut to start a model and chat
                   Example: cortex run
```

## Storage

By default, Cortex CLI stores model binaries, thread history, and other usage data in:
`$(npm list -g @janhq/cortex)`. 

You can find the respective folders within the `/lib/node_modules/@janhq/cortex/dist/` subdirectory.

In progress: 
- Changing storage location
- Additional database types like mysql or postgresql

## Syntax

For a full list of available CLI commands, [see here](/cortex/cli-overview).

**OpenAI API Equivalence**

Cortex CLI commands strictly follows OpenAI API method names as a convention.

For example, the `cortex chat` command is equivalent to the `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint ([read more](/cortex/cortex-chat)). 

The `cortex models get ID` command is equivalent to the `GET /models ${ID}` endpoint ([read more](/cortex/cortex-models)).

**Command Chaining**

To improve developer experience, Cortex CLI supports command chaining and syntactic sugar on top of the base CLI syntax. 

For example, `cortex run`, inspired by Docker and Github, starts the models and the inference engine, and provides a command line chat interface for easy testing ([read more](/cortex/cortex-run)).

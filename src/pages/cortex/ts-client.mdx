# Typescript Client Library

Cortex comes with an Typescript client library that can be used as a **2-line, drop-in replacement for OpenAI's** [Node.js/Typescript library](https://github.com/openai/openai-node).

## Installation

Coming soon: 

```js
npm install @janhq/cortex
```

## OpenAI Replacement

Replacing OpenAI Client Library with Cortex Client Library is as simple as replacing the import & construction statements.

```diff
- const openai = require('openai')
+ const { Cortex } = require('@janhq/cortexjs')
```

Then just

```diff
- const client = new openai.Client(process.env.OPENAI_SECRET_KEY)
+ const client = new Cortex()
```

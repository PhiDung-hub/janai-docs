# Cortex Overview

Cortex is a stateful, self-hostable server that is 100% compatible with the OpenAI (OAI) Platform.

It includes an OAI-compatible API gateway, request queues, database integrations, multi-model orchestration and more.

This guide walks you through how Cortex is designed, the code structure, and future plans.

## Usage

See [Quickstart](/cortex/quickstart)

## Interface

Cortex adopts the OpenAI API standard and is fully compatible with your existing projects. In addition to OpenAI endpoints, Cortex provides parameters for full flexibility.

You can find the reference documentation here:
- Swagger
- API reference

## Architecture

```mermaid
<!-- todo -->
```

Cortex is built with NestJS and handles all requests through a Node server. At the core, Cortex has a C++ runtime that handles stateless requests.

### Data

Cortex comes with a baked in SQLite database that can be swapped out for any other database.

## Code Structure

[Cortex](https://github.com/janhq/cortex) is a monorepo with two projects: `cortex-js` and `cortex-cpp`.

```markdown
janhq/cortex
â”œâ”€â”€ cortex-js           # Stateful implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ cortex-cpp          # Stateless implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile          
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### cortex-js

`cortex-js` folder contains stateful implementations, some of which call into `cortex-cpp`.

```markdown
janhq/cortex/cortex-js
â”œâ”€â”€ src                 # 
    â”œâ”€â”€ domain/         # 
    â”œâ”€â”€ extensions/     # 
    â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/ # 
    â”œâ”€â”€ usecases/       # 
    â”œâ”€â”€ command.ts      # 
    â””â”€â”€ main.ts         #
â”œâ”€â”€ nest-cli.ts         #
â”œâ”€â”€ constant.ts         #
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        #
â””â”€â”€ README.md           #
```

### cortex-cpp

`cortex-cpp` folder contains first-class, stateless implementations.

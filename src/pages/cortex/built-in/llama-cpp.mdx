## Overview

Jan has a default [C++ inference server](https://github.com/janhq/nitro) built on top of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). This server provides an OpenAI-compatible API, queues, scaling, and additional features on top of the wide capabilities of llama.cpp.

### CPU Instruction
The prebuilt Nitro with the `llama.cpp` inference engine requires running with the correct CPU instruction. AVX2 is the standard CPU instruction set in Jan, commonly used in newer Intel and AMD processors. However, older CPUs that support AVX or AVX-512 may require customization of the default CPU instruction.
<Callout type="info">
    The CPU instruction configuration is only applicable to the Windows and Linux versions.

    To Update CPU Instructions for Jan Applications Using AVX, follow these steps:
    1. Check what your CPU uses for processing. For AVX, please see the list of CPUs [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#CPUs_with_AVX).
    2. Navigate to your Jan Data folder, which is usually found at `C:/Users/<name>/jan`(Windows) or `~/jan`(Linux)
    3. Download the appropriate Nitro version based on your CPU, GPU, and system specifications from [here](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/releases/tag/v0.3.15).
    4. Unzip the downloaded Nitro file.
    5. Move the new Nitro files to the correct location in your Jan folder. Make sure it's not nested in another folder.
    6. Restart the Jan app.

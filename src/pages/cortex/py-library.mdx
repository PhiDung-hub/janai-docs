# Python Library

Cortex comes with a Python client library that can be used as a **drop-in replacement for OpenAI's** [Python Client library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).

## Installation

Coming soon: 

```python
pip install @janhq/cortex
```

## OpenAI Replacement

Replacing OpenAI Client Library with Cortex Client Library is as simple as replacing the import & construction statements.

```diff
- import openai form openai
+ import openai from @janhq/cortex
```

Replaces OpenAI with open AI.

# `cortex pull`

Downloads models from a variety of model hubs, including ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

Models download to the node_modules directory by default ([see more](/cortex/cli#storage)).

## Usage

### Preconfigured Models

Reconfigured models (with optimal runtime parameters and templates) are available from the [Jan Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/janhq) on Hugging Face.

These models can be easily downloaded via a Docker like interface, i.e. `model_name:variant_tag`

```bash
cortex pull llama3:7b
```

### Hugging Face Models

You can download any GGUF, TensorRT, or supported-format model directly from Hugging Face.

```bash
# cortex pull HF_MODEL_ID
cortex pull TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF
```

# `cortex pull`

Downloads models from a variety of model hubs, including ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

Models download to the `node_modules` library path by default ([see more](/cortex/cli#storage)).

## Alias
- `cortex pull _`
- `cortex download _`

## Usage

### Preconfigured Models

Reconfigured models (with optimal runtime parameters and templates) are available from the [Jan Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/janhq) on Hugging Face.

These models can be easily downloaded via a Docker like interface, i.e. `model_name:variant_tag`

```bash
# Pull a model most compatible with your hardware
cortex pull llama3

# Download a specific variant
cortex pull llama3:7b
```

Model variants, across quantizations and sizes, are stored in the Repo's branches. 

### Hugging Face Models

You can download any GGUF, TensorRT, or supported-format model directly from Hugging Face.

```bash
# cortex pull HF_MODEL_ID
cortex pull microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf
```

### Managing Models

The `models` subcommand allows for managing models. To view the available options, run:

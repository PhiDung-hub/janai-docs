# Privacy

Thinking Machines is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible way. This policy outlines how we collect, store, and use your personal information when you use any of our products.

## Data Collection

Jan, Cortex, and all Thinking Machines products do not collect personally identifying information. Your conversation history and usage data stays on your own computer.

For troubleshooting, you can opt-in to send Jan non-personal information, such as your device type, operating system, and application telemetry, which do not contain personally identifying information. This information is used to improve our app and to provide you with a better user experience.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal information with third parties except as required by law or as necessary to provide you with the services you have requested.

## Data Security

We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.

## Your Choices

You have the right to access, update, and delete your personal information at any time. If you subscribed to our newsletter, you may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe link included in our emails.

## About

We are **Thinking Machines**, a robotics company. We work on the intersection of humans and machines.

At present, we are building the layer between AI and hardware, to turn your computer into an AI PC.

We like open-source. We like local-first. We love hardware. ❤️

## Mission

[Jan](https://jan.ai), powered by Cortex, is **an open-source & self-hosted alternative to OpenAI's platform.**

## Open Source

We believe that the future of AI should be built on open-source foundations.

- [Jan: Desktop Client](https://jan.ai/) (AGPLv3)
- Cortex: Local AI server (AGPLv3)

We build on the shoulders of open source giants: [llama.cpp](https://jan.ai/docs/local-inference/llamacpp), [tensorrt-llm](https://jan.ai/docs/local-inference/tensorrtllm).

## Local & Private

By default, Jan runs AI locally on your device. Your data, models, and training dataset are stored on your local filesystem. No data leaves your computer. You own the underlying AI.

## Build in Public

We openly share our roadmap, metrics, and strategy.

- [Jan's Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/janhq/projects/5/views/29)
- [Engineering Discussions (Discord)](https://discord.gg/AAGQNpJQtH)

## Bootstrapped

Jan is currently a bootstrapped startup. We balance technical invention with the search for a sustainable business model, by creating real value for our community.

We welcome business inquiries: hello@jan.ai

## Comparisons

> "I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them." - Isaac Asimov

Jan was founded on the belief that AI should coexist with humans, not replace them.

We are committed to creating open, local-first products that give back human control, reject dark patterns & ecosystem lock-ins, while providing a comprehensive solution for advanced applications.

|  | Alternatives | Jan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy | Questionable | Private, with enhanced data protection |
| Transparency | Closed source | Open source, and customizable |
| Ownership | Give away your IP | You own the AI (the IP) |
| Standardization | Custom APIs | 100% OpenAI Compatible |
| Customization | Infrastructure lock-in | Plug & play |
| Hosting | Monthly cloud bills | Self-hosted |
| Data | Cloud-based | Local filesystem based, with database options |
| Outage Resilience | Potential hostage & API throttling | Works offline |

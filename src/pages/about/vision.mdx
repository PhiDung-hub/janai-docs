# Vision: Thinking Machines

We want to continue a legacy of **craftsmen making tools** that propel humanity forward.

## Collaborating with Thinking Machines

Our vision is to develop thinking machines that work alongside humans.

We envision a future where AI is safely used as a tool in our daily lives, like fire and electricity. These robots enhance human potential and do not replace our key decision-making. The underlying AI is owned at an individual or team level.

## Solarpunk, not Dune

Our vision is rooted in an optimistic view of AI's role in humanity's future.

Like the Solarpunk movement, we envision a world where technology and nature coexist harmoniously, supporting a sustainable and flourishing ecosystem.

We focus on AI's positive impacts on our world - from environmental conservation to the democratization of energy, AI has the potential to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our planet.

## Add Models

There are various ways to add models to Jan.

Currently, Jan natively supports the following model formats: 
- GGUF (through a llama.cpp engine)
- TensorRT (through a TRT-LLM engine)

### Download from Jan Hub

You can choose from a list of popular, recommended models directly from Jan app's Model Hub. 
These models are preconfigured with optimal runtime parameters. This is the easiest way to get started. 

1. Navigate to the Hub
2. Select models, clicking on the `v` dropdown to see more information. Models with the `Recommended` label are likely to run faster on your computer.
3. Click use after the model has finished downloading
4. Ensure that the model is selected in the thread's model dropdown

### Import or Symlink Local Models

You can also point to existing model binary files on your local filesystem. 
This is the easiest and most space efficient way if you already use other local AI applications.

1. Navigate to the Hub
2. Click on `Import Model` at the top
3. Select the model or the folder containing multiple models
4. Optionally, check the box to symlink the model files instead of copying them over the Jan Data Folder. This saves disk space.

:::warning
Windows users must drag & drop the model file. If you select `Click to Upload`, your Folder Preview may not display the model files.

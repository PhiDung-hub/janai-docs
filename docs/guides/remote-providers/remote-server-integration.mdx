This guide will show you how to configure Jan as a client and point it to any remote or local (self-hosted) API server.

This section will show you how to configure a client connection to a remote/local server using Jan's API server running model `mistral-ins-7b-q4` as an example.

:::note

Currently, you can only connect to one OpenAI-compatible endpoint at a time.

:::

### 1. Configure a Client Connection

1. Navigate to the `~/jan/engines` folder.
2. Modify the `openai.json file`.

:::note

Please note that currently, the code that supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint only reads `engine/openai.json` file. Thus, it will not search any other files in this directory.

:::

3. Configure `full_url` properties with the endpoint server that you want to connect. For example, if you're going to communicate to Jan's API server, you can configure it as follows:

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  // "full_url": "https://<server-ip-address>:<port>/v1/chat/completions"
  "full_url": "https://<server-ip-address>:1337/v1/chat/completions"
  // Skip api_key if your local server does not require authentication
  // "api_key": "sk-<your key here>"
}
```

### 2. Create a Model JSON

1. In `~/jan/models`, create a folder named `mistral-ins-7b-q4`.

2. In this folder, add a `model.json` file with Filename as `model.json`, ensure the following configurations:

- `id` matching folder name.
- `Format` set to `api`.
- `Engine` set to `openai`
- `State` set to `ready`.

```json title="~/jan/models/mistral-ins-7b-q4/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "janai",
      "url": "https://jan.ai"
    }
  ],
  "id": "mistral-ins-7b-q4",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "Mistral Instruct 7B Q4 on Jan API Server",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Jan integration with remote Jan API server",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "MistralAI, The Bloke",
    "tags": ["remote", "awesome"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```

### 3. Start the Model

1. Restart Jan and navigate to the **Hub**.
2. Locate your model and click the **Use** button.

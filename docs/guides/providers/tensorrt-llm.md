:::info

TensorRT-LLM support was launched in 0.4.9, and should be regarded as an Experimental feature.

- Only Windows is supported for now.
- Please report bugs in our Discord's [#tensorrt-llm](https://discord.com/channels/1107178041848909847/1201832734704795688) channel.

Jan supports [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) as an alternate Inference Engine, for users who have Nvidia GPUs with large VRAM. TensorRT-LLM allows for blazing fast inference, but requires Nvidia GPUs with [larger VRAM](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/memory.html).

## What is TensorRT-LLM?

[TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) is an hardware-optimized LLM inference engine for Nvidia GPUs, that compiles models to run extremely fast on Nvidia GPUs.

- Mainly used on Nvidia's Datacenter-grade GPUs like the H100s [to produce 10,000 tok/s](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/blogs/H100vsA100.html).
- Can be used on Nvidia's workstation (e.g. [A6000](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-6000/)) and consumer-grade GPUs (e.g. [RTX 4090](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/))

:::tip[Benefits]

- Our performance testing shows 20-40% faster token/s speeds on consumer-grade GPUs
- On datacenter-grade GPUs, TensorRT-LLM can go up to 10,000 tokens/s
- TensorRT-LLM is a relatively new library, that was [released in Sept 2023](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/graphs/contributors). We anticipate performance and resource utilization improvements in the future.

:::

:::warning[Caveats]

- TensorRT-LLM requires models to be compiled into GPU and OS-specific "Model Engines" (vs. GGUF's "convert once, run anywhere" approach)
- TensorRT-LLM Model Engines tend to utilize larger amount of VRAM and RAM in exchange for performance
- This usually means only people with top-of-the-line Nvidia GPUs can use TensorRT-LLM

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Windows PC
- Nvidia GPU(s): Ada or Ampere series (i.e. RTX 4000s & 3000s). More will be supported soon.

Please ping us in Discord's [#tensorrt-llm](https://discord.com/channels/1107178041848909847/1201832734704795688) channel if you would like Turing support.

:::

### Software

- Jan v0.4.9+ or Jan v0.4.8-321+ (nightly)
- [Nvidia Driver v535+](https://jan.ai/guides/common-error/not-using-gpu/#1-ensure-gpu-mode-requirements)
- [CUDA Toolkit v12.2+](https://jan.ai/guides/common-error/not-using-gpu/#1-ensure-gpu-mode-requirements)

## Getting Started

### Install TensorRT-Extension

1. Go to Settings > Extensions
2. Install the TensorRT-LLM Extension

:::info
You can check if files have been correctly downloaded:

```sh
ls ~\jan\extensions\@janhq\tensorrt-llm-extension\dist\bin
# Your Extension Folder should now include `nitro.exe`, among other `.dll` files needed to run TRT-LLM
```

:::

### Download a TensorRT-LLM Model

Jan's Hub has a few pre-compiled TensorRT-LLM models that you can download, which have a `TensorRT-LLM` label

- We automatically download the TensorRT-LLM Model Engine for your GPU architecture
- We have made a few 1.1b models available that can run even on Laptop GPUs with 8gb VRAM

| Model               | OS      | Ada (40XX) | Ampere (30XX) | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Llamacorn 1.1b      | Windows | ✅         | ✅            | TinyLlama-1.1b, fine-tuned for usability            |
| TinyJensen 1.1b     | Windows | ✅         | ✅            | TinyLlama-1.1b, fine-tuned on Jensen Huang speeches |
| Mistral Instruct 7b | Windows | ✅         | ✅            | Mistral                                             |

### Importing Pre-built Models

You can import a pre-built model, by creating a new folder in Jan's `/models` directory that includes:

- TensorRT-LLM Engine files (e.g. `tokenizer`, `.engine`, etc)
- `model.json` that registers these files, and specifies `engine` as `nitro-tensorrt-llm`

:::note[Sample model.json]

Note the `engine` is `nitro-tensorrt-llm`: this won't work without it!

### Using a TensorRT-LLM Model

You can just select and use a TensorRT-LLM model from Jan's Thread interface.

- Jan will automatically start the TensorRT-LLM model engine in the background
- You may encounter a pop-up from Windows Security, asking for Nitro to allow public and private network access

:::info[Why does Nitro need network access?]

- This is because Jan runs TensorRT-LLM using the [Nitro Server](https://github.com/janhq/nitro-tensorrt-llm/)
- Jan makes network calls to the Nitro server running on your computer on a separate port

### Configure Settings

## Troubleshooting

## Extension Details

Jan's TensorRT-LLM Extension is built on top of the open source [Nitro TensorRT-LLM Server](https://github.com/janhq/nitro-tensorrt-llm), a C++ inference server on top of TensorRT-LLM that provides an OpenAI-compatible API.

### Manual Build

To manually build the artifacts needed to run the server and TensorRT-LLM, you can reference the source code. [Read here](https://github.com/janhq/nitro-tensorrt-llm?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart).

### Uninstall Extension

1. Quit the app
2. Go to Settings > Extensions
3. Delete the entire Extensions folder.
4. Reopen the app, only the default extensions should be restored.
